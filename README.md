### Problem Domain

The purpose of the project is to update the prescription, doctor’s report, pharmacy’s updated inventory and the patient information in the MobileMed application in order to streamline the patient check-up process. 

The model focuses on helping a patient treated by the doctor obtain medicine prescribed by the doctor through the pharmacy. It is assumed that the drug is available at the pharmacy, the doctor is qualified enough to create a prescription and a pharmacy will always be on hand.

MobileMed requires a site that:

Allows the user submit their profile and medications history
Alerts user to schedule to see doctor
Allows user to see list of current medications and old medications
Allows doctor to edit current medications and send note to pharmacist
Allows user to add/remove medications

### Solution As developers is a patient who suspects that they are ill, and possesses the technological expertise to operate a software application and is capable of using MobileMed. 


The site will include the following pages:

Home/Login
Patient
Doctor/Dashboard
Pharmacist/Dashboard
